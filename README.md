Tasks for Lab 5 of the NMD 105 course, this assignment made greater use of if conditionals and tested the keyPressed() function in order to get user input from the keyboard.

The first task is to implement boundaries on the edges of the screen to have a ball bounce inside the screen. The ball also starts at a random location on the screen.
The second task is to have an icon move by grabbing the keyboard inputs from a user. The program takes the arrow keys to have the bear move in 4 directions.
